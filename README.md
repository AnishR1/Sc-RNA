# Sc-RNA

This library shows the various scripts that are used while analysing the sc-RNA seq data

## Seurat processing
This contains the standard workflow steps that are involved while analyzing sc-RNA seq data

## Seurat_FindMarkers
It is a downstream analysis that helps us to find the markers after analyzing the sc-RNA data

## Seurat_doubletFinder
This allows us to classify if the cells are singlets or doublets and thus making it easier to filter out doublets which cause problems during downstream analysis

## Seurat_harmony
This is a way of integrating multiple datasets in R using harmony

## Seurat_integration
This is a very cumbersome way of integrating multiple datasets
